# SpecialAgent Templates — Autonomous Company Roles

Pre-built role templates for bootstrapping an autonomous AI company.
Each role is a self-contained agent profile with personality, instructions,
domain skills, and a tailored workspace.

**Default template** (used when no role is specified) lives at
`marketplace/roles/default/profile` and `marketplace/roles/default/workspace`.
Role templates live under `marketplace/roles/{role}/profile` and
`marketplace/roles/{role}/workspace`.

## Template Structure

Each role follows the standard profile layout. **TOOLS.md** and **USER.md** use the same content as the default template. **AGENTS.md** holds role-specific instructions (concise responsibilities and guidelines).

```
<role>/
├── profile/
│   ├── AGENTS.md        # Role intro, core responsibilities, guidelines
│   ├── TOOLS.md         # Same as default (full tool docs, cron, heartbeat, planning)
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── agent.yaml   # Model, temperature, tool settings
│   └── skills/          # Domain-specific skills
└── workspace/
    ├── README.md        # Same as default
    ├── HEARTBEAT.md     # Provisioned to .agents/HEARTBEAT.md
    └── memory/          # Provisioned to .agents/memory/
        ├── MEMORY.md    # Long-term memory
        └── HISTORY.md   # Event log
```

## Usage

When provisioning a new agent, specify the role template:

```bash
specops agent create --name "alice" --template sre
specops agent create --name "bob" --template finance-controller
specops agent create --name "alice" --template sre --mode process   # run as subprocess
specops agent create --name "ops" --template sre --mode docker      # run in container
```

- **`--template`** — Role template (e.g. `sre`, `ceo`). Omit to use the default profile/workspace.
- **`--mode`** — Execution mode: `process` (one subprocess per agent) or `docker` (one container per agent). Omit to use the app's default pool backend.

The provisioner copies the role's `profile/` and `workspace/` into the
agent's directory, then converts `config/agent.yaml` to `.config/agent.json`.

## Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate via the `message` tool. Each role template includes
an `a2a` (agent-to-agent) skill that documents the communication protocol
and the other roles in the company. Agents can delegate tasks, request
information, and escalate issues to the appropriate peer.

## Customization

These templates are starting points. After provisioning, each agent's
workspace is fully editable — you can refine AGENTS.md, add skills,
adjust heartbeat tasks, and tune model parameters per agent.
